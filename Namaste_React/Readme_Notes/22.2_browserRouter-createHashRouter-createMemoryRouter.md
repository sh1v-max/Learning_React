# 📌 **React Router Types**  

React Router provides different types of routers to handle navigation in a React application.  

## 📝 **What is a Router in React?**  
A **router** in React is a mechanism that enables navigation between different pages (or components) in a **Single Page Application (SPA)** without requiring a full page reload.  

React Router offers three main types of routers:  
1. **`BrowserRouter`** – Uses the browser’s history API for clean URLs.  
2. **`createHashRouter`** – Uses the `#` symbol in the URL for routing.  
3. **`createMemoryRouter`** – Stores routes in memory, without changing the URL.

## 1️⃣ **`BrowserRouter` – Standard Router**  
### 📌 **What is `BrowserRouter`?**  
`BrowserRouter` is the **default router** in React Router that uses the **HTML5 History API** (`pushState`, `replaceState`) to update the URL in the browser without refreshing the page.  

### ✅ **How it Works**  
- It allows navigation with **clean URLs** (e.g., `/about`, `/profile`).  
- Uses the **browser's history** for navigation (Back & Forward buttons work normally).  
- Needs **server configuration** to handle page refreshes correctly.  

### 🏆 **Best For:**  
✔ Single Page Applications (SPAs)  
✔ Websites with a **configured backend**  
✔ **SEO-friendly URLs**  

### ❌ **Disadvantages:**  
- **Requires server-side configuration** to prevent `404` errors on page refresh.  
- **Not ideal for static hosting** (like GitHub Pages) without additional setup.  

### 🔹 **Example Usage:**  
```jsx
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from "react-router-dom";
import Home from "./Home";
import About from "./About";

function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## 2️⃣ **`createHashRouter` – Hash-Based Router**  
### 📌 **What is `createHashRouter`?**  
`createHashRouter` is a router that manages navigation using **the hash (`#`) part of the URL** instead of the browser’s history API.  

### ✅ **How it Works**  
- The URL contains a `#` symbol (e.g., `https://example.com/#/about`).  
- The browser ignores everything **before the `#`**, so no request is sent to the server.  
- Since it does not depend on the server, it **works on static hosting** (GitHub Pages, Firebase Hosting, etc.).  

### 🏆 **Best For:**  
✔ Static hosting environments (e.g., **GitHub Pages**)  
✔ Websites where the **server cannot be configured**  
✔ **Older browsers** that do not support HTML5 history API  

### ❌ **Disadvantages:**  
- URLs are **not as clean** due to the `#`.  
- **SEO limitations** (some search engines may not crawl hash-based URLs properly).  

### 🔹 **Example Usage:**  
```jsx
import { createHashRouter, RouterProvider } from "react-router-dom";
import Home from "./Home";
import About from "./About";

const router = createHashRouter([
  { path: "/", element: <Home /> },
  { path: "/about", element: <About /> }
]);

function App() {
  return <RouterProvider router={router} />;
}

export default App;
```

## 3️⃣ **`createMemoryRouter` – In-Memory Router**  
### 📌 **What is `createMemoryRouter`?**  
`createMemoryRouter` is a router that **keeps track of navigation in memory** instead of modifying the URL in the browser.  

### ✅ **How it Works**  
- It does **not update the browser’s URL**.  
- Navigation is handled completely in **JavaScript memory**.  
- Primarily used for **testing, server-side rendering (SSR), or React Native apps**.  

### 🏆 **Best For:**  
✔ **Unit testing** (e.g., testing navigation logic with Jest)  
✔ **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** (e.g., Next.js, Remix)  
✔ **React Native applications** (where browser history is unavailable)  

### ❌ **Disadvantages:**  
- The **URL in the browser does not change** when navigating between pages.  
- **Not suitable for production web apps** that need real URL navigation.  

### 🔹 **Example Usage:**  
```jsx
import { createMemoryRouter, RouterProvider } from "react-router-dom";
import Home from "./Home";
import About from "./About";

const router = createMemoryRouter([
  { path: "/", element: <Home /> },
  { path: "/about", element: <About /> }
]);

function App() {
  return <RouterProvider router={router} />;
}

export default App;
```

## 🏆 **Comparison Table**
| Router | What is it? | Best For | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------------|---------|------|------|
| **BrowserRouter** | Uses browser history API for clean URLs | Standard web apps | Clean URLs, SEO-friendly | Requires server config to prevent 404 |
| **createHashRouter** | Uses `#` in the URL to prevent server requests | Static hosting (GitHub Pages, Firebase) | No server config needed | Ugly `#` in URLs, SEO issues |
| **createMemoryRouter** | Stores navigation in memory, without modifying the URL | Testing, SSR, React Native | No dependency on browser history | No real URL navigation |

---

### 🎯 **Which One Should You Use?**
- Use **`BrowserRouter`** for **regular web apps** with a configured backend.  
- Use **`createHashRouter`** if your site is **hosted statically** (GitHub Pages, Firebase).  
- Use **`createMemoryRouter`** for **unit testing, SSR, or React Native apps**.
